# Soil Humidity Meter with Arduino


## Description

The Soil Humidity Meter with Arduino is a project that allows you to monitor and measure the moisture level of soil in your garden or plant pots. It provides real-time data on soil moisture, helping you ensure that your plants receive the appropriate amount of water.

## Features

- Measures and displays soil humidity levels.
- Arduino-based for flexibility and customization.
- Suitable for indoor and outdoor gardening.
- Real-time monitoring and data visualization.

## Components

To build this project, you will need the following components:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Soil moisture sensor
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Display module (e.g., OLED, LCD)
- Power supply (battery or USB)
- Enclosure (optional for outdoor use)
- Resistors and capacitors (if necessary)
- Soldering iron and solder (if needed)


## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/soil-humidity-meter.git

2.Set up the Arduino IDE on your computer if not already installed.

3.Connect the soil moisture sensor to the Arduino board according to the circuit diagram.

4.Upload the Arduino sketch (soil_humidity_meter.ino) to your Arduino board.

## Usage
1.Power on the Arduino board and soil moisture sensor.

2.Place the soil moisture sensor in the soil you want to monitor.

3.The display module will show the current soil humidity level.

4.Customize the project as needed for your specific application, such as sending data to a remote server or adding an alert system.
